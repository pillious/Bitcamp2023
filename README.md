## Bitcamp 2023 Hackathon Submission

Challenge:

Fannie Mae - Don’t Put All Your Eggs in One Basket (2)

Employing classic algorithms to create high-value collateral pools from mortgages

Our challenge to you: Utilize a knapsack algorithm to fill a knapsack with objects without exceeding the knapsack’s weight capacity. In this challenge, the knapsack is a pool of mortgages, the weight capacity is a monetary value (we’ll supply that at the start of the challenge), the objects are mortgages, the weight of a mortgage is its unpaid principal balance, and the value of a mortgage is determined by a number of other attributes associated with the mortgage.

We supply the data (loans, knapsack “capacity”). You supply the ingenuity, the solution infrastructure, and the implementation approach.

Your solution to the challenge will be evaluated based on completeness, innovation, and performance/throughput.
